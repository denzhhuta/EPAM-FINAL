It's actually a small web-page for booking tables at the restaurant. Can be used as a layout for future projects. Additionally it has a connected telegram bot (wrote on aiogram), that recieves booking confirmations + have functionality for the stuff to manage bookings.

The main app.py is written on Flask, serves as a server, that recieves requests (POST, etc..)

If the restaurant staff canceles the reservation - a guest will be informed!
